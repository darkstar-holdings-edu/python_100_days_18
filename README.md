## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) [^1]
* tkinter

[^1]: Note: I use `pipenv` becaue I like the combination of the `venv` and `pip` commands together. However, I know it's not for everyone. So I've created a `requirements.txt` file if you don't like `pipenv` and just want to use `pip` instead.

### Installation

```sh
pipenv install -e .
pipenv shell
```

## Usage

`main.py` is a collection of all the section "challenges". It has a collection of functions. Near the bottom of the file, there is a list of the function calls. These can just be commented and uncommented to run the specfic function.

`project.py` is the final section project that creates a Damian Hirst "[dot painting](https://www.google.com/search?q=hirst+dot+painting)".
